This project is to build on practicing my basic HTML knowledge that I have learned while doing the Odin project. 
I will be building a basic recipe website that will have a main index page which will have a few links to a few recipes. Some inspiration for tasty treats!

After completing this project, I have accomplished:

Properly setting up html files accordingly
Linked html files together
Embedded images with alternative text
Created ordered and unordered lists for the steps and recipes
Added a Home/main page button on recipes sites to go back to starting page
used body and paragraph elements to describe what the recipe is all about
